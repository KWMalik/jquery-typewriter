jquerytypewriter is a jQuery plugin to do the "typewriter" effect.

It's based on the movie WarGames when the computer, Joshua, was playing tic tac toe. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLJ3zcdPtl8#t=3m32s)

You can see it in action here:

Checkout demo.html for example usage.

In general, it's like this:
 $('.someselector').typewrite({
    'delay': 100, //time in ms between each letter
    'extra_char': '', //"cursor" character to append after each display
    'callback': null // if exists, called after all effects have finished
});
